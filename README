Enchanting for MineClone2
--------------------------

This is a rewrite of the mtg enchanting mod. Beta Version, more features coming soon.
The textures look absolutely shit, but as far as I know I have to use the textures from Pixel Perfection so I dont get trouble with Mocrisoft. There is a version with original textures and sounds, but I can't publish that one. If you'd like to advice me how I can somehow do that anyway, please open an issue or contact me via email (eliasfleckenstein@web.de).
